Hello 👋

Welcome to my blog.

You can play some background music at the bottom while you explore my work and thoughts.

You can use the search bar or the tags to find what you're looking for.

The goal of this blog is to share my knowledge on Software Engineering subjects and learn even more while doing so.

Everything here will reference sources so that you can go deeper if you want to.

Enjoy.
